        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. 
            Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, 
            ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. 
            Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

        <h2>Etymology of Travel</h2>
        <p>The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, 
            which means 'work'. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. 
            It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and 
            earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). <br>
            In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. 
            According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more 
            ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).
            This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or 
            may not be much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure 
            travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, 
            cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.</p>

    <h2>Adventure Travel</h2>
        <p>Adventure travel is a type of tourism, involving exploration or travel with a certain degree of risk (real or perceived), 
        and which may require special skills and physical exertion. In the United States, adventure tourism has seen growth in late 20th 
        and early 21st century as tourists seek out-of-the-ordinary or "roads less traveled" vacations, but lack of a clear operational 
        definition has hampered measurement of market size and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade Association, 
        adventure travel may be any tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with outdoor 
        activities and nature.
        Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping 
        outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and 
        involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, 
        bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, 
        Geocaching, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and 
        ghetto tourism. Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.
        Access to inexpensive consumer technology, with respect to Global Positioning Systems, flashpacking, social networking and photography, 
        have increased the worldwide interest in adventure travel. The interest in independent adventure travel has also increased as more 
        specialist travel websites emerge offering previously niche locations and sports.
        Adventure sports tourism has traditionally been dominated by men. Although women's participation has grown, the gender gap is still 
        pronounced in terms of quantitative engagement in these forms of sport tourism. Yet, in competitive adventure sport tourism, the 
        success rate of females is currently higher than that of males.</p>
